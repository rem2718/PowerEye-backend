# PowerEye Web Server
This server hosts the user interface, handles HTTP requests through RESTful APIs, manages user authentication, and facilitates user interactions.

## How to Run It:

1. Download packages or libraries needed by running 
    ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the server using 
    ```

    ```

## Important Note:
